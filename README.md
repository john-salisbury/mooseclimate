John Salisbury - NTNU Master's Thesis Project

## How does moose herbivory affect carbon and albedo dynamics in successional boreal forest?

This is the GitHub repo for John Salisbury's MSc Biology thesis project. It is a subset of NTNU's SustHerb project, which seeks to explore the role of large herbivores in Norwegian forest dynamics. 

This project has two major components:

### Exclosure component:
An analysis of aboveground tree biomass, surface albedo, and climate forcing across 10 years of forest herbivore exclosure in 44 study sites across Norway. 

**Data**:
* Spatiotemporal dataset of tree species, diameter-at-ground-level (cm), and height (cm) - provided by SustHerb project at NTNU
* Spatiotemporal snow water-equivalent (SWE) and temperature (K) observations at each study site - provided by SeNorge (Norwegian Meteorological Institute)

**Key Methods**:
* Biomass calculations done using locally-calibrated biomass models by [Kolstad et al. (2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-017-0202-4)
* Albedo estimates made using non-linear albedo models developed by [Hu et al. (2018)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001403)
* Net climate forcing estimates made by NTNU Department of Industrial Ecology using methods adapted from [Cherubini et al. (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1747423X.2018.1529831?journalCode=tlus20)


### Spatial component: 
An exploratory spatial analysis of the relationship between large herbivore density and forest surface albedo in early successional forest.
