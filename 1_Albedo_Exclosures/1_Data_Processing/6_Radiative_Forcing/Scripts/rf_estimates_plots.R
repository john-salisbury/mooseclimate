## Script to calculate radiative forcing using albedo and delta biomass (kg/m2)

## Note - delta biomass (annual timescale) and delta albedo (monthly and annual timescale)
## are calculated for EACH PLOT (subplot values of biomass and albedo are averaged, THEN
## deltas are calculated - thus, the RF estimates produced by this script will be on the
## PLOT level)
